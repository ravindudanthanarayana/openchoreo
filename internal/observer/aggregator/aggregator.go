// Package aggregator implements the DORA aggregator: a background worker in the
// observer that folds delivery signals into the durable delivery insights store.
// Each tick it reads incidents and delivery lifecycle events since its per-source
// watermark, normalizes them into deployment/recovery facts, attributes incidents to
// the deployment live at trigger time, and recomputes the metric rollups for every
// bucket it touched. FEATURE_PREVIEW_DELIVERY_INSIGHTS_ENABLED turns the whole thing
// on; there is no
// separate switch for the events path, since partial DORA metrics are not worth
// configuring. The sweep does need a logs adapter carrying the reasons filter and
// able to return events across every namespace in one query rather than a scope at
// a time -- an adapter that cannot answers 501, and only the incident path runs.
//
// Correctness rests on the store's semantics, not on tick bookkeeping: facts
// upsert on stable keys with sticky-failure merge rules, rollups are recomputed
// from facts and fully replaced (never incremented), and watermarks advance only
// after a tick commits — so re-processing any window, or a full backfill, is
// idempotent by construction.
//
// Exactly one replica aggregates at a time. Every replica runs this loop, but a
// tick only proceeds while the replica holds the aggregation lease in the store,
// so an Observer can be scaled for read traffic without the sweeps colliding.
